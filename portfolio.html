						<p>This piece was inspired by the <em>Buddhas of Bamiyan</em>, a worldly historic monument that previously stood 55 and 38 meters tall, and by Olomi's own recreation of the Western Buddha at the Hotel Inter-Continental, Kabul.</p>
						<p>He re-constructed it from concrete and strong materials “because it needed to last forever.” Olomi's recreation of the historic Buddha statue was destroyed by the Taliban in August, 2021. They have also destroyed many other pieces of his art across Afghanistan.</p>
						<p>This piece, <em>The Great Buddhas of Afghanistan</em>, depicts the history of the great Buddhas over the last 2000 years as well as news clippings and Olomi's messages surrounding the Buddhas</p>

						<p>Olomi would be happy to hand deliver the piece to Elon and thank him for his help with Starlink.
